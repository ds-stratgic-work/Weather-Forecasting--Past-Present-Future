Weather Forecasting Past Present & Future
The forecasting procedure is consistent across weather types. Researchers analyze current observations using advanced technologies like radar, satellite imagery, and data from ground-based and airborne instruments to understand prevailing conditions.

In July 1949, the BBC aired its first regular television weather forecast, featuring a hand-drawn weather chart and a script from the Met Office, before the computer revolutionized weather prediction. These early forecasts were based on Jacob Bjerknes's World War One theories, which introduced weather fronts—boundaries between cold and warm air. Meteorologists used these principles to mark isobars and fronts on maps, a method still essential for short-term weather and wind predictions today.

Contemporary weather predictions rely on powerful computers. The Met Office's first operational forecast on November 2, 1965, used a machine that performed 60,000 calculations per second. In contrast, the current Cray XC40 supercomputer executes 14 quadrillion calculations per second, with a £1.2 billion successor on the way that will reach 60 quadrillion calculations per second. This increase in computational power has led to higher resolution, longer-range, and more accurate forecasts.
